        <h1>FEATURES OF AI PROGRAMMING</h1>
        <p>According to Brook ordinary programming languages donâ€™t have the abilities to deal with qualitative information. So, the AI machines, are programmed to work with their own developed programming language to manipulate knowledge more effectively. AI programs are different from ordinary programming languages. They are written to manipulate predominantly qualitative rather than numeric information. They use declarative knowledge, i.e. assertions whose truth-value is independent of the algorithmic context. They can induce, deduct and sometimes guess data. They can reconsider decisions by employing back tracking for solutions.</p>
